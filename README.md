# qremoteobject
Remote object library that utilizes the built-in signal/slot structure of Qt


# Must have a valid meta object compiler (moc)  modified for QRemoteObjects
   - Not a hard dependency for building library or examples, but the examples will not work as intended
   - see [RMOC latest](https://github.com/Tpimp/rmoc/tree/5.12)


# To Build

 - Pull the repository
 - open either qremoteobject.qbs or one of the example's top level qbs file in Qt Creator.
 - build and (run if example) as usual
